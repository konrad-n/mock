# Integration Tests Fix Summary

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **TestDataFactoryExtensions.cs**
   - Fixed AddressDto ambiguity by adding alias
   - Removed incorrect Username parameter from SignUp command

2. **UsersControllerTests.cs**
   - Removed Username parameter from all SignUp commands
   - Fixed SignIn commands to use username instead of email

3. **IntegrationTestBase.cs**
   - Fixed SignUp command to use positional parameters without Username

4. **UserProfileControllerTests.cs**
   - Fixed Commands.AddressDto references to just AddressDto

5. **ProceduresControllerTests.cs**
   - Fixed OperatorCode parameter to Name
   - Added missing ExecutionType and SupervisorName parameters
   - Fixed GetByIdAsync calls to use ProcedureId value object

6. **MedicalShiftsControllerTests.cs**
   - Added missing Minutes, Location, and Year parameters to AddMedicalShift commands

7. **Fix Script Updates**
   - Added step to fix SignUp commands (though SignUp doesn't have Username)
   - Updated TestDataFactoryExtensions template in script

## ‚ùå Remaining Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Value Object Confusion**: Many places trying to call `.Value` on int types when they should be using domain entities with value object IDs
2. **Entity Creation**: Tests trying to use non-existent constructors or Create methods
3. **DTO Mismatches**: DashboardOverviewDto structure doesn't match test expectations

### Files with Major Issues
- **DashboardControllerTests.cs**: DTO property mismatches, entity creation issues
- **CoursesControllerTests.cs**: HasCertificate parameter issues, entity creation
- **DomainEventIntegrationTests.cs**: Entity creation with missing parameters
- **SimpleDomainTests.cs**: Missing constructor parameter
- **TestDataFactory.cs**: Address constructor issue

## üîß Recommendations

1. **Review Domain Model**: The tests seem to be based on an older version of the domain model. Need to review current entity structures and update tests accordingly.

2. **Update TestDataFactory**: The TestDataFactory helper methods need to be updated to match current entity constructors.

3. **Fix DTO Expectations**: Either update the DTOs to match test expectations or update tests to match current DTO structure.

4. **Systematic Approach**: Given the large number of errors, consider:
   - Running tests one file at a time
   - Fixing entity creation patterns first
   - Then fixing command parameters
   - Finally fixing assertions

## üìù Next Steps

1. Check the current domain entity constructors and factory methods
2. Update TestDataFactory to use correct entity creation patterns
3. Fix DashboardControllerTests to use correct DTO properties
4. Review and fix remaining entity creation issues

The integration tests need significant updates to match the current domain model and API structure. This appears to be a case where the tests were written for an earlier version of the application and haven't been kept in sync with domain model changes.
