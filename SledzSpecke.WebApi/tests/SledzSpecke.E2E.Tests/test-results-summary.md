### Failure Analysis
All tests are failing at the login stage with a timeout error. The tests are trying to access the production URL (https://sledzspecke.pl) but the login page is not responding within the 30-second timeout.

### Possible Causes
1. The production website might be down or not accessible
2. The login page selector (`input[name='username']`) might have changed
3. Network connectivity issues
4. The application requires additional setup or configuration

### Recommendations
1. Verify that https://sledzspecke.pl is accessible and the login page loads
2. Update the test configuration to use a test environment if available
3. Check if the login page HTML structure has changed
4. Consider increasing the timeout for the initial page load
5. Add retry logic for network-related failures

### Next Steps
1. Manual verification of the application URL
2. Update test selectors if needed
3. Configure a dedicated test environment
4. Add better error handling and logging
5. Implement screenshot capture on failures for debugging
