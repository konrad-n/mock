# SledzSpecke Web API Migration Tasks

## Original Requirements

Your main task now is to get rid of projects/mock/SledzSpecke.App (MAUI) and projects/MySpot. We are now in WEB.API project projects/mock/SledzSpecke.WebApi and I want to be left with only this project. But first we need to apply all clean code principles from example project MySpot and have all the logic persisted from MAUI old project SledzSpecke.App.

Remember to compare to project MySpot that is example of SOLID web api and is two folders above the current one we are in. Also always test your changes and check if api is working after EACH change. Remember we are creating this api as a replacement for MAUI app SledzSpecke.App that is one folder above this one. We need to work the same. Also .json files with specialization info cannot be changed - it is official government requirements. I trust you will be very precise and know what makes sense to do as you are the most powerful and perfect .NET senior architect and developer that creates very clean code that applies to all patterns like SOLID, KISS, YAGNI etc.

Also review written unit/integration tests in WEB.API solution if they make sense looking at what we have in MAUI project.

### Needs Implementation
- ‚ùå User profile management endpoints
- ‚ùå File upload/download for certificates
- ‚ùå Export/reporting functionality
- ‚ùå Sync status management endpoints
- ‚ùå Educational activities endpoints
- ‚ùå Search and filtering endpoints

- ‚ùå Batch operations
- ‚ùå Year transition management
- ‚ùå File upload/download for certificates
- ‚ùå Export functionality
- ‚ùå Sync status management
- ‚ùå Complete implementations for partially done controllers

## Architecture Patterns from MySpot to Apply
- ‚úÖ CQRS pattern with separate commands and queries
- ‚úÖ Value Objects for domain primitives
- ‚úÖ Repository pattern
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Decorator pattern for cross-cutting concerns (partially implemented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consistent error handling with custom exceptions
- ‚ùå Assembly scanning for auto-registration
- ‚ùå Extension methods for DTO mapping instead of AutoMapper
- ‚ùå Simplified entity design (remove unnecessary AggregateRoot)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] All new endpoints return correct HTTP status codes
- [ ] Authorization works correctly (users can only access their own data)
- [ ] Validation errors return meaningful messages
- [ ] Database operations are transactional
- [ ] Progress calculations match MAUI app formula
- [ ] Specialization JSON files are correctly loaded
- [ ] All CRUD operations work for each entity
- [ ] Statistics endpoints return accurate data

## Notes
- Always test API after each change
- Specialization JSON files must not be modified (government requirements)
- Follow SOLID, KISS, YAGNI principles
- Maintain compatibility with MAUI app functionality
- Use Result pattern for enhanced error handling where appropriate
