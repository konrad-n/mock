## Chapter 4: Repository Pattern Migration Guide

### Overview

This chapter outlines the refactoring strategy for improving the repository pattern implementation in the SledzSpecke application. The goal is to reduce code duplication, improve testability, and make queries more maintainable using the Specification pattern.

### Current State

#### Problems with Current Implementation
1. **No inheritance from BaseRepository** - All repositories implement everything from scratch
2. **Duplicate query logic** - Same queries repeated across repositories
3. **Direct SaveChangesAsync calls** - Should be handled by Unit of Work
4. **Complex joins in repositories** - Makes testing difficult
5. **ID generation duplicated** - Same logic in multiple repositories

### Target Architecture

#### 1. Generic Repository Interface
```csharp
public interface IGenericRepository<TEntity> where TEntity : AggregateRoot
{
    // Basic CRUD
    Task<TEntity?> GetByIdAsync(int id, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<IEnumerable<TEntity>> GetAllAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task AddAsync(TEntity entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    void Update(TEntity entity);
    void Remove(TEntity entity);
    
    // Specification-based queries
    Task<IEnumerable<TEntity>> GetBySpecificationAsync(ISpecification<TEntity> specification);
    Task<TEntity?> GetSingleBySpecificationAsync(ISpecification<TEntity> specification);
    Task<int> CountBySpecificationAsync(ISpecification<TEntity> specification);
}
```

#### 2. Specification Pattern
```csharp
// Instead of:
public async Task<IEnumerable<MedicalShift>> GetByDateRangeAsync(DateTime start, DateTime end, int userId)
{
    // Complex query logic here
}

// Use:
var specification = new MedicalShiftByInternshipIdsSpecification(internshipIds)
    .And(new MedicalShiftByDateRangeSpecification(start, end));
var shifts = await repository.GetBySpecificationAsync(specification);
```

#### 3. Repository Implementation
```csharp
public class SqlMedicalShiftRepository : BaseRepository<MedicalShift>, IMedicalShiftRepository
{
    // Only implement domain-specific methods
    // Let BaseRepository handle common operations
}
```

### Refactoring Steps

#### Step 1: Create Specifications (✅ Completed)
- Created specifications for MedicalShift, User, Internship
- Added composite specifications for common queries
- Location: `/src/SledzSpecke.Core/Specifications/`

#### Step 2: Update BaseRepository (✅ Completed)
- Added IGenericRepository interface implementation
- Added pagination and count methods for specifications
- Enhanced with specification support

#### Step 3: Refactor Individual Repositories (🔧 In Progress)
1. **MedicalShiftRepository** - ✅ Example created as `RefactoredSqlMedicalShiftRepository`
2. **UserRepository** - ✅ COMPLETED (2025-06-16) - `RefactoredSqlUserRepository`
3. **InternshipRepository** - ✅ COMPLETED (2025-06-16) - `RefactoredSqlInternshipRepository`
4. **ProcedureRepository** - 🎯 Next priority - Already has specifications
5. Others as needed

| UniversityRepository | ✅ Refactored | RefactoredSqlUniversityRepository - Completed 2025-06-17 |

### Key Fixes Applied During Migration

1. **BaseRepository Ordering Support**: Added overload `GetBySpecificationAsync<TKey>()` for ordering results
2. **Navigation Property Issues**: Fixed Module.Specialization navigation that doesn't exist by using explicit joins
3. **And() Extension Conflicts**: Resolved Npgsql namespace conflicts by properly constructing specifications
4. **Value Object Converters**: Added missing EF Core converters for ModuleId, ShiftType, and InternshipStatus

### Migration Strategy

#### Step 4: Gradual Migration
1. **Keep old repository initially**
2. **Create new repository inheriting from BaseRepository**
3. **Run side-by-side temporarily**
4. **Test thoroughly before switching**

#### Step 5: Update Command Handlers

**Before** (Repository handles SaveChanges):
```csharp
public sealed class AddMedicalShiftHandler : ICommandHandler<AddMedicalShift, int>
{
    private readonly IMedicalShiftRepository _repository;
    
    public async Task<int> HandleAsync(AddMedicalShift command)
    {
        var shift = MedicalShift.Create(/* ... */);
        return await _repository.AddAsync(shift); // Repository saves changes
    }
}
```

**After** (UnitOfWork handles SaveChanges):
```csharp
public sealed class AddMedicalShiftHandler : ICommandHandler<AddMedicalShift, int>
{
    private readonly IMedicalShiftRepository _repository;
    private readonly IUnitOfWork _unitOfWork;
    
    public async Task<int> HandleAsync(AddMedicalShift command)
    {
        var shift = MedicalShift.Create(/* ... */);
        await _repository.AddAsync(shift); // Only adds to context
        await _unitOfWork.SaveChangesAsync(); // UnitOfWork handles transaction
        return shift.Id.Value;
    }
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication** - Common logic in BaseRepository
2. **Better Testability** - Specifications can be unit tested
3. **Composable Queries** - Combine specifications with And/Or/Not
4. **Cleaner Repositories** - Focus on domain logic, not infrastructure
5. **Consistent Pattern** - All repositories follow same structure

### Example Usage

```csharp
// Before: Complex query in repository
var shifts = await _context.MedicalShifts
    .Where(s => s.InternshipId == internshipId && 
                s.Date >= startDate && 
                s.Date <= endDate &&
                s.IsApproved)
    .ToListAsync();

// After: Composable specifications
var spec = new MedicalShiftByInternshipSpecification(internshipId)
    .And(new MedicalShiftByDateRangeSpecification(startDate, endDate))
    .And(new MedicalShiftByApprovalStatusSpecification(true));
var shifts = await repository.GetBySpecificationAsync(spec);
```

#### Needs Migration
1. 🔧 Remaining 12 repositories to adopt specification pattern
2. 🔧 Domain service implementations need business logic
3. 🔧 Remove SaveChangesAsync from repositories
4. 🔧 Implement ID generation service

### 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

#### Phase 1: Repository Migration (1-2 days)
```csharp
// Priority order:
1. UserRepository       // Most used
2. InternshipRepository // Complex queries
3. ProcedureRepository  // Already has specifications
4. Others              // As needed
```

#### Phase 2: Domain Service Implementation (3-5 days)
- Add real SMK business rules
- Implement validation logic
- Add compliance checking
- Monthly report generation

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1 week)
- Minimal API migration
- Process managers/Sagas
- Event sourcing for audit
- Performance optimization

### 📝 Technical Debt Tracker

#### High Priority
1. **Password Hash Format** (9 test failures)
   - Issue: Tests expect different hash format than implementation
   - Location: User value object tests
   - Impact: Test suite not fully green

2. **Repository SaveChangesAsync** 
   - Issue: Repositories shouldn't manage transactions
   - Location: All 13 repository implementations
   - Solution: Use Unit of Work pattern

3. **ID Generation Service**
   - Issue: Manual ID assignment needs centralization
   - Location: Throughout command handlers
   - Solution: Implement IIdGenerationService

#### Medium Priority
4. **Domain Service Implementation**
   - Current: Stub implementations only
   - Need: Real SMK business rules from government specs
   - Files: ISMKSynchronizationService, IModuleCompletionService

5. **Repository Migration** 
   - Status: 1/13 repositories use specification pattern
   - Remaining: UserRepository, InternshipRepository, etc.
   - Guide: Chapter 4 of this document

#### Low Priority
6. **Minimal API Migration**
   - Current: Traditional controllers
   - Target: .NET minimal APIs for better performance

7. **Event Sourcing**
   - Current: State-based persistence
   - Future: Audit trail requirements may need event sourcing

### 🎓 Key Design Decisions

1. **Simplified Domain Services**: Created working stubs rather than guessing at business logic
2. **Specification First**: Focused on query patterns before repository refactoring
3. **Event Infrastructure**: Built complete system ready for business logic
4. **Incremental Migration**: Allows gradual adoption without breaking changes
5. **Test Coverage**: Added tests for new patterns while maintaining existing suite
