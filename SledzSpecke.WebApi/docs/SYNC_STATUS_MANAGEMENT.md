# Sync Status Management Documentation

## Overview

The Sync Status Management system tracks the synchronization state of entities between the local application and the SMK (System Monitorowania Kszta≈Çcenia) system. This document explains the implementation details and design decisions.

## Key Design Decision

**Important Change**: Unlike the original MAUI implementation where synced items were read-only, the Web API implementation allows synced items to be modified. When a synced item is updated, it automatically transitions to `Modified` status, maintaining an audit trail while allowing data corrections.

## Sync Status States

The `SyncStatus` enum has five possible values:

1. **NotSynced (0)**: Entity has never been synchronized with SMK. Default state for new entities.
2. **Synced (1)**: Entity is synchronized with SMK with no local changes. Can be modified (will auto-transition to Modified).
3. **SyncError (2)**: Error occurred during last sync attempt. Entity may have partial data.
4. **SyncFailed (3)**: Sync attempt failed completely. Entity remains in previous state.
5. **Modified (4)**: Previously synced entity has been modified locally. Needs re-synchronization.

## Implementation Details

### Affected Entities

The following entities implement sync status management:
- `MedicalShift`
- `ProcedureBase` (and derived classes)
- `Internship`
- `Course`

### Automatic Status Transitions

When any update method is called on a synced entity, it automatically transitions to `Modified` status:

```csharp
// Example from MedicalShift.UpdateShiftDetails
if (SyncStatus == SyncStatus.Synced)
{
    SyncStatus = SyncStatus.Modified;
}
```

### Modification Rules

- **Synced items**: CAN be modified (auto-transition to Modified)
- **Approved items**: CANNOT be modified (throw exception)
- **Other statuses**: Can be modified normally

### Code Example

```csharp
// Before update
var shift = await _repository.GetByIdAsync(shiftId);
// shift.SyncStatus == SyncStatus.Synced

// Update the shift
shift.UpdateShiftDetails(8, 30, "New Hospital");
// shift.SyncStatus == SyncStatus.Modified (automatic transition)

await _repository.UpdateAsync(shift);
```

## Migration from MAUI

### Key Differences

1. **MAUI**: Synced items were completely read-only
2. **Web API**: Synced items can be modified (with automatic status transition)

### Rationale

This change was made to:
- Allow users to correct data errors in synced items
- Maintain audit trail of changes
- Support more flexible workflows
- Reduce user frustration with locked data

## Testing

The test script (`test_api.py`) includes comprehensive testing for sync status transitions. Key test scenarios:

1. Creating new entities (NotSynced status)
2. Updating synced entities (transition to Modified)
3. Attempting to update approved entities (should fail)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot modify synced item" errors**
   - Check if you're using old code that prevents synced modifications
   - Ensure entity's `EnsureCanModify()` method is updated

2. **Status not transitioning to Modified**
   - Verify update methods include the transition logic
   - Check that the entity was actually synced before update

3. **Database sync status mismatch**
   - Run migrations to ensure database schema is current
   - Check Entity Framework configurations

### Database Queries

Check entity sync status:
```sql
-- PostgreSQL
SELECT "Id", "SyncStatus", "IsApproved" FROM "MedicalShifts" WHERE "Id" = 1;
SELECT "Id", "SyncStatus", "Status" FROM "Procedures" WHERE "Id" = 1;
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Sync Queue**: Implement a queue for Modified items awaiting sync
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts when SMK data changes during local modifications
3. **Batch Sync**: Support bulk synchronization of Modified items
4. **Sync History**: Track sync attempts and results for auditing
