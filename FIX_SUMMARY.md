# SledzSpecke Fixes Applied - June 19, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. JWT Configuration (FIXED)
**Problem**: JWT tokens failed with "The signature key was not found"
**Solution**: 
- Generated secure JWT signing key
- Created appsettings.Production.json with proper configuration
- Updated base appsettings.json to include the key
- Deployed to production

**Result**: JWT authentication now works correctly

### 2. Database Connection (FIXED)
**Problem**: Connection string used wrong username (www-data)
**Solution**: Updated to use correct database user (sledzspecke_user)

### 3. PWZ Validation (FIXED)
**Problem**: SignUpValidator and PwzNumber used different validation algorithms
**Solution**: Updated SignUpValidator to match PwzNumber.cs algorithm

### 4. User-Specialization Relationship (FIXED)
**Problem**: Specializations table missing UserId column
**Solution**: 
- Added UserId to entity configuration
- Created and applied migration
- Linked test user to specialization

## üîß Current State

### Authentication ‚úÖ
```bash
# Login works
curl -X POST https://api.sledzspecke.pl/api/auth/sign-in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Username": "api.test@wum.edu.pl", "Password": "Test123"}'

# Returns valid JWT token
```

### Test Credentials
- Email: `api.test@wum.edu.pl`
- Password: `Test123`
- UserId: 7
- SpecializationId: 1 (Kardiologia - old SMK)

### Database Schema Updates
- Added UserId to Specializations table
- Password format: SHA256 Base64 (e.g., `2bX1jws4GYKTlxhloUB09Z66PoJZW+y+hq5R8dnx9l4=` = "Test123")

### File Storage (FIXED)
- Created `/var/www/sledzspecke-uploads` directory with proper permissions
- API no longer crashes on startup due to permissions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

### Dependency Injection
Many controllers have DI issues with missing command handlers:
- MedicalShiftsController - All CRUD operations fail with handler registration errors
- ProceduresController - All CRUD operations fail with handler registration errors
- UserProfileController - Cannot retrieve user profile
- DashboardController - Throws exception due to incomplete User-Specialization relationship

This appears to be an architectural issue where handlers aren't registered properly in Program.cs.

### Empty Responses
Most endpoints return empty data because:
- Medical shifts don't have UserId column (uses InternshipId instead)
- Complex relationships between entities
- Missing test data

### Dashboard Access
The dashboard endpoint (`/api/dashboard/overview`) intentionally throws an exception with the message:
"User-Specialization relationship needs to be redesigned. Cannot retrieve dashboard data."

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **For Full Functionality**:
   - Register all command/query handlers in DI
   - Add proper test data with relationships
   - Consider simplifying the architecture

2. **For Testing**:
   - Use direct database access to verify data
   - Test v2 minimal API endpoints which may work better
   - Focus on simpler operations first

## üìù Configuration Files

### /var/www/sledzspecke-api/appsettings.Production.json
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=sledzspecke_db;Username=sledzspecke_user;Password=mypassword"
  },
  "auth": {
    "issuer": "sledzspecke-api",
    "audience": "sledzspecke-users",
    "signingKey": "tzmSWjnbfWg9OC3YGv/5fehZAu7f86iY3W2h9X5rgR0=",
    "expiry": "01:00:00"
  }
}
```

## Summary

The core authentication and database connectivity issues have been resolved. The system can now:
- ‚úÖ Authenticate users with JWT
- ‚úÖ Connect to the database
- ‚úÖ Validate registration data correctly
- ‚úÖ Link users to specializations
- ‚úÖ API starts without crashing

However, the main functionality requested by the user (CRUD operations on procedures and medical shifts) is NOT working due to dependency injection issues. 

### Test Results Summary:
- ‚úÖ Registration: Fixed PWZ validation algorithm
- ‚úÖ Login: Works with test credentials
- ‚ùå Dashboard: Circular dependency with decorators
- ‚ùå Procedures CRUD: Circular dependency with decorators
- ‚ùå Medical Shifts CRUD: Circular dependency with decorators

### Current Issues:
1. **Circular Dependency**: The decorator pattern implementation creates circular dependencies when query handlers are resolved
2. **Handler Mismatch**: Controllers expect `ICommandHandler` but handlers implement `IResultCommandHandler`
3. **Adapter Registration**: Created adapters but decorator registration creates conflicts

### Attempted Fixes:
1. Created `ResultToCommandHandlerAdapter` to bridge the interface mismatch
2. Created simple handler implementations for testing
3. Added handler registrations in `Extensions.cs`

The remaining issues are related to the complex CQRS architecture with decorators creating circular dependencies. This would require either:
- Removing decorators entirely
- Fixing the decorator registration order
- Simplifying the architecture to use direct handlers without decorators
